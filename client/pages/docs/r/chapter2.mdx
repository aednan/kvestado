# Blockchain

![Blockchain!](/img/docs/Bitcoin_Block_Data.svg "Block Data")

> [Figure 1: Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain "Wiki").

Blockchain is one of the most important technologies used on the Web 3.0. It aims to provide a
public and non-centralized data store.
Imagine a database where information is stored in blocks. These blocks can be copied and
replicated to individual computers.
All of these blocks are identical and are synchronized with each other. When someone adds or
removes data, it changes the information in the entire chain.
Blockchain is often referred to as an immutable, real-time record of transactions and ownership.
But what does it mean? Basically, it's a reliable, hard-to-manipulate record of transactions - and a
record of who owns what.
New blocks with new information are always appended at the end of the chain, each addition has
its own digital signature or hash value, which is a series of numbers and letters. The more
confirmations (blocks added on top of that last block), the more difficult it becomes
to manipulate it.
The best way to explain how the blockchain works is to take a closer look at the community
aspect. It is based on what is known as distributed ledger technology “DLT”.

Each individual in the peer-to-peer network that together forms this ledger can view the same
information in individual blocks.
A transaction recorded on one computer or node is visible on every computer in the digital
network. Everyone sees the same data. In addition, anyone can reject or verify what they see.
For this reason, it is very difficult to hack the technology. The data is not controlled by just one
computer, and a change in one block would mean that the entire chain that starts with that block
would have to change its signature and be based on the new block hash.
Everyone has a copy that is automatically updated, and everyone must verify the changes on the
chain or network.

## 2.1 Bitcoin

It is a cryptocurrency based on the blockchain technology that supports peer to peer transactions
without interfering with third parties such as banks.
it's a peer-to-peer network that uses proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions,
which quickly becomes computationally infeasible for an attacker when honest nodes control the
majority of CPU power.
The nodes all operate at once with little coordination.
They do not need to be identified because messages are not routed to a specific location and need
only be delivered on a best effort basis.
Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as evidence of
what happened while they were away.
They vote with their CPU power by accepting valid blocks by working on their extension, and
rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them.
All necessary rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

## 2.2 Ethereum Blockchain (Network)

The Ethereum blockchain, just like Bitcoin, tracks the ownership of digital currency, but
additionally specializes in the execution of programming code of various decentralized apps
(DApps) such as voting systems, and payment methods.
Ethereum allows users to create self-executing contracts, called smart contracts, that are
automatically executed when certain preconditions are met. These actions can include releasing
funds to appropriate parties, registering vehicles, sending notifications, or issuing a ticket.
Like Bitcoin, Ethereum operates outside the influence of central authorities such as banks and
governments.

## 2.3 Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are computer code on the blockchain that allow the implementation of digital
contracts that are executed automatically as soon as a certain event occurs.
Smart contracts can thus be used to implement certain contracts automatically without the need
to formalize a contract in writing.
Once a smart contract is deployed on the network (Blockchain), it becomes immutable and
cannot be changed. If the contract contains errors,
a new contract should be created and migrated to it.
