# Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

Every one of us uses applications. Whether it's Firefox, Netflix, Uber or anything else,
applications have become part our lives. Whether it's a web, desktop, or mobile applications,
they all work in roughly the same way.
And a revolution is underway, and a new, potentially disruptive type of applications is beginning
to emerge, The decentralized applications:
But before we get into what decentralized applications "DApps" are and how they affect you and
me, let's first take a look at the traditional, regular kind of applications we're all used to working
with.
Some problems that can occur with centralized applications:
Those applications make getting things done a lot easier, and most popular apps are incredibly
easy to use. After all, many of the most popular apps today have been iterated over several years
at the cost of millions of dollars.
But despite the utility and benefit that many of these apps provide, there is downsides that can
make them less desirable than they first seem.
After all, they are generally owned and operated by corporations that might not necessarily have
your best interests in mind.

- Data misuse
  As we have already mentioned, our data is in the hands of these corporations and
  centralized, we ourselves do not own our data, but they do, and they have the ability to
  misuse it and access it without our permission.
  And since these applications collect more than just personal data from end users.
  This data can be sold to third parties without our knowledge, and it can even be leaked if
  the application is hacked.

- Censorship
  Due to local restrictions, some applications may limit access for certain end users,
  allowing them to use the service only partially or not at all.

- Loss of access
  Sometimes, the application or the entire company may experience a downtime, causing us
  to lose access to our own stored data, as it is centralized and can only be accessed through
  the company's services.
  The solution to all of this are DApps, but what are decentralized applications:

### 1.1.1 Decentralized Applications - DApps

    Decentralized applications, run on a decentralized blockchain network that can be hosted
    by thousands or possibly even millions of nodes (Servers), each of which has a backup of
    the DApp. They are not controlled by a single entity.
    This makes them virtually impossible to block, while ensuring that they are accessible no
    matter what. This makes them perfect for important applications like health and personal
    finance applications.
    With most blockchains, virtually anyone can start a node to add another backup to the
    DApp, and there are usually rewards for those who do, such as staking rewards.
    In addition, some DApps are also directly focused on community governance, giving users
    a say in how the DApp grows and develops. This usually requires ownership of
    governance tokens of the DApps, which give users voting rights.

> The aim of the following work is to show and clarify some possible uses of Web3 and
> Blockchain technology by the use of DApps with existing Web 2.0 technologies, considering
> many aspects from both Web2.0 and Web 3.0 in the following thesis.
> The following question might arise, what’s web3?
> Web 3.0 (Web3) is the successor of web 2.0 and to better understand the term web 3.0, however,
> we should first look back a few years ago, in particular to the beginnings of Web 1.0
> and Web 2.0.

### 1.1.2 Web 1.0

    Indicates the first Phase of the Internet, roughly from 1991 to 2004 and it consists mainly
    of static pages.
    Characteristics, some common design elements of a Web 1.0 site include:
    - Static pages rather than dynamic HTML.
    - Content provided from the server's filesystem rather than a relational database
      management system (RDBMS).
    - Pages built using Server Side Includes or Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
      instead of a web application written in a dynamic programming language such as
      Perl, PHP, Python or Ruby.
    - The use of HTML 3.2-era elements such as frames and tables to position and align
      elements on a page. These were often used in combination with spacer GIFs
    - Proprietary HTML extensions, such as the \<blink> and \<marquee> tags,
      introduced during the first browser war.
    - Online guestbooks.
    - GIF buttons, graphics (typically 88×31 pixels in size) promoting web browsers,
      operating systems, text editors and various other products.
    - HTML forms sent via email. Support for server-side scripting was rare on shared
      servers during this period. To provide a feedback mechanism for web site visitors,
      Mailto forms were used. A user would fill in a form, and upon clicking the form's
      submit button, their email client would launch and attempt to send an email
      containing the form's details. The popularity and complications of the Mailto
      protocol led browser developers to incorporate email clients into their browsers.
      (Wikipedia, 2022).

### 1.1.3 Web 2.0

    The term Web 2.0 is not understood to mean a fundamentally new type of technology
    or application, but rather the term describes a changed use of the Internet,
    in which its possibilities are consistently used and further developed.
    It represents an evolutionary stage with regard to the offering and use of
    the World Wide Web, in which the focus is no longer on the pure spread of information or
    the sale of products by website operators, but on user participation in the Web and the
    generation of further additional benefits.

### 1.1.4 Web 3.0

    Web 3.0 envisions a decentralized, immutable version of the world wide web (WWW)
    that is free of intermediaries and has the same cryptographic verifiability.
    as Cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and DApps, a new form of decentralized applications based
    on a distributed systems.
